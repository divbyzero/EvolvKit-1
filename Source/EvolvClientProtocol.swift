     it will immediately apply the value retrieved and then when the new
     allocation returns it will reapply the new changes if the experiment
     has changed.

     - key: A unique key identifying a specific value in the participants allocation.
     - defaultValue: A default value to return upon error.
     - function:  a handler that is invoked when the allocation is updated
     - <T>: type of value to be applied to the execution.
